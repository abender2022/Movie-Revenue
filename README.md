# Predicting Movie Revenue

For my capstone project, I developed a predictive model to analyze movie genres and forecast their revenue based on various features. Using a dataset from TMDB, I performed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering to identify key factors influencing movie revenue.

The project utilized machine learning techniques, including linear regression, random forests, and gradient boosting models like LightGBM and XGBoost, to build predictive models. Correlation analysis revealed that vote count, budget, and IMDb votes were the strongest predictors of revenue. Additionally, natural language processing (NLP) techniques were applied to analyze textual features like movie overviews.

The goal of this project was to provide insights into entertainment industry trends and develop a tool that helps content creators, producers, and streaming platforms make data-driven decisions.
